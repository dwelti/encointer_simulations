# Welcome to the Encointer Simulation System!

You can run the Encointer Simulation System to see an analysis of the results of using Encointer in real life.

## How to run the Encointer Simulation System?

We recommend to create a virtual environment, though this is not necessary:
```sh
conda create --name encointer python=3.9
conda activate encointer
```

You should have Python 3.9 installed.

Next, just run the following command to install packages that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
