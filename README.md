# Welcome to Encointer Simulations!

In economically disadvantaged countries, citizens often struggle to meet their basic needs. Encointer (https://encointer.org/) is a new technology that allows communities to launch their own digital currencies, so-called community currencies, to supplement national legal tender. The community currencies can not only be used for purchasing goods and services, but are also issued as a regular basic income among participants. To compensate for this rising inflation, the value of a token is lowered constantly through a mechanism known as demurrage.

You can run the Encointer Simulation System to see an analysis of the results of using Encointer in real life.

## How to run the Encointer Simulation System?

We recommend to create a virtual environment, though this is not necessary:
```sh
conda create --name encointer python=3.9
conda activate encointer
```

You should have Python 3.9 installed.

Next, just run the following command to install packages that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, execute the Python code using Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm.
